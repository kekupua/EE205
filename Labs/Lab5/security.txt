Things we've talked about:
 - OS Command Injection
 - Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
 - Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
 - Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
 - Uncontrolled Format String
 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Buffer Overflow:
  Buffer overflow can be dangerous to the security of a network or program. Security is the cornerstone of any project and cannot be negelected.
  If neglected, security can be the downfall of your company. 
  As a programmer, it is important to understand the limitations of your code and to write optimal code.
  When writing the code for a program, it is important to take into account necessary inputs and conditions.
  For instance, the programmer should take into account data type size at any given point in the program.
  If not, the programmer runs the risk of heading into buffer overflow.

Favorite Vulnerability:
  Personally, I find the hard-coding of credentials interesting. When testing code,
  it is normal to hard-code some test cases in order to stress test your program.
  It can be common for these hard-coded lines to make it through debugging and get to production.
  If the programmer is not diligent in maintaining their code, this is an easy vulnerability to
  intercept. Programmers should not allow themselves to fall into a sense of safety when there is so much risk on maintaining a system.
  Code should be written as well as possible the first time and well documented to ensure proper extensibility when time allows.
