Didn't include string library
Missing constructor for Token(char,string)
Broken quit and let case in get switch statement
Missing bracket at end of main
Had to compile with -std=gnu++11
Ex: 5 2 * gives 2
Program gives the answer one line later then expected
Program doesn't know how to handle operators after operands properly. When given an operator after operands, it says 'primary expected'
However, program does handle giving operators between operands but not anything else
Also, parentheses don't seem to work as intended
If you hit an error such as bad token or primary expected, the buffer doesn't clear unless you hit ;
